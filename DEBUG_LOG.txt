# Debug / Maintenance Log

## 2026-02-16
- Fixed SceneManager to respect an injected Babylon engine when provided.
- Fixed GUI texture activation during scene load so the loaded scene gets an active GUI reference.
- Added a scene index guard in scene switching to avoid undefined scene errors.
- Added optional debug logs (enabled with `?debug=true`) for scene selection, load status, switching, and timing.
- Updated README with a dedicated debugging notes section and typo fixes.
